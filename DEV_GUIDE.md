## Getting Started üèÅ

Ensure you have the following installed before proceeding:
- Flutter SDK: [Installation Guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
- Dart SDK (usually comes with Flutter)
- An IDE such as XCode, Android Studio, IntelliJ, or VS Code with Flutter and Dart plugins

## Steps to Build and Run the Flutter App

### 1. Clone the repository
### 2. Navigate to the project folder
### 3. Install Dependencies
Before building the app, you need to install all the required dependencies. This is done using the following command:

    flutter pub get



This command fetches all the packages listed in your `pubspec.yaml` file and installs them in your project. It's similar to `npm install` in Node.js or `pip install` in Python.

### 4. Run Code Generation
Flutter uses code generation for various tasks, such as generating JSON serialization code, Hive adapters, or any other generated files. To run the code generation, use the `build_runner` package with the following command:

    
    flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
    

- `build_runner build`: This command generates the necessary files based on your annotations and configuration.
- `--delete-conflicting-outputs`: This flag ensures that any conflicting files generated by previous runs are deleted before generating new ones. It helps avoid issues with stale or duplicate generated files.

### 5. Run the App
Now, you can run your Flutter application using the following command:

    
    flutter run
    

This command compiles your Flutter app and installs it on the connected device or emulator. If you have multiple devices connected, you may be prompted to select one.

## Additional Tips
- To view detailed logs while running the app, use `flutter run -v`.
- If you need to clean the project (e.g., to fix build issues), use `flutter clean` and then repeat the steps above.
- To run the app in release mode for better performance, use `flutter run --release`.
